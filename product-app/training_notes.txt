// npx create-react-app product-app

1. Layout Engines has lot to do with rendering.
2. Keeping DOM in sync with data causes lots of issues with perfornmence.
3. React exposes a virtual dom avoiding devs not to manipulate actual dom.
4. virtual dom : VD
5. Created through render method in components.
6. VD - stateless, immutable
7. Expectation is optimize components.
8. Diff : Algo to decide what changes we had
9. Payload will not make difference in NewLayout Engine. (Download/Latency)
10. Code Splitting and npm run build and host it to production server.

/////How to decide components
1. Single Responsibility
2. Reusable
3. Testability
4. perfornmence (V.Dom)

//// Creating Configurations
1. WebPack
2. Babel
3. NPM NO need of --save in npm 5+
4. Semantic Version : react@
5. NPX - to install stuffs globally
6. EJECT - ejects all the webpack commands


////ES-6 Fundamentals
1. let, const
2. for..of loop, for..in loop (index)
3. default parameters
4. rest operator func(name, ...args) for(let arg of args)//console.log(arg) - creates array.
5. spread operator : unpacks the array elements to avoid aray or array. Used for copying object.
6. DeConstruct let data = {a:1, b:2}
let {a, c} = data; can be used as function object.
7. class : can-not overload member functions in javascripts (no overloading)
- this is explicit
- super("Circle")- creates a prototype chain
- static - should be out side class (ES-6), but in ES-Next
8. Arrow functions :- resolves the "this" and sets caller as context
9. Tamplate Literals : BackQuote ` and ${}
10. Module : Each file is a module, Multi Export and Import (import * as tm from "./sdas" - alising)
11. deafult export : one in a class : import default : without {} //default import is alias by deafult
12. Promise, Map/Set, 
13. ES7 : Array prototype
14. ES8 : async and await
15. ES.Next : spread operdator for object (es6 for array only)
16. items.map((item, index) => `<CartItem id=${item.id} index=${item.index} />`)

////VS Code 
>=

////React :
1. components : class and functional comps
2. Siblings can't share data directly
3. Props are immutable, don't modify
4. use ES.Next for event binding
5. all the methods are stacked but executed only once 
6. forceupdate will skip shouldComponentUpdate but setstate always reads shouldComponentUpdate.
7. key : is a Keyword and we can't read it in props , similar to children
8. Mutability : immutablity (mutable.js for huge data)
    cItems = [...items] //Spread operator clones data only, a shallow copy (copies data, with a new reference)
    object : cItem = {...item1, price:100} // item wont change
9. should not use splice method //use filter : this.state.items.filter(item => item.id != id );
10. LifeCycle :
        -Create,
        -DeStruct,
        -Update
11. Do not do much code in constructor, better use initialize method.
12. initialize state in componentWillMount.
13. use ajax calls in componentDidMount (client side rendering) will re-render
14. higher order components
15. User React.Fragment, use if no view to render.
16. use componentWillUnmount to clear call threads, unsubscribe etc - perfornmence
17. Update Cycle :- 5 steps
18. setstate also contains a call back, however it renders twice has specific case to use
19. Use Pure components for comparison
