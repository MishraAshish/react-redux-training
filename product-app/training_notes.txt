1. Layout Engines has lot to do with rendering.
2. Keeping DOM in sync with data causes lots of issues with perfornmence.
3. React exposes a virtual dom avoiding devs not to manipulate actual dom.
4. virtual dom : VD
5. Created through render method in components.
6. VD - stateless, immutable
7. Expectation is optimize components.
8. Diff : Algo to decide what changes we had
9. Payload will not make difference in NewLayout Engine. (Download/Latency)
10. Code Splitting and npm run build and host it to production server.

/////How to decide components
1. Single Responsibility
2. Reusable
3. Testability
4. perfornmence (V.Dom)

//// Creating Configurations
1. WebPack
2. Babel
3. NPM NO need of --save in npm 5+
4. Semantic Version : react@
5. NPX - to install stuffs globally
6. EJECT - ejects all the webpack commands


////ES-6 Fundamentals
1. let, const
2. for..of loop, for..in loop (index)   : While for...in iterates over property names, for...of iterates over property values
    var arr = [3, 5, 7];
    arr.foo = "hello";
    for (let i in arr) {
        console.log(i); // logs "0", "1", "2", "foo"
    }

    for (let i of arr) {
        console.log(i); // logs "3", "5", "7"
        //it is does not log "3", "5", "7","hello"
    }

3. default parameters
4. rest operator func(name, ...args) for(let arg of args)//console.log(arg) - creates array.
5. spread operator : unpacks the array elements to avoid aray or array. Used for copying object.
6. DeConstruct let data = {a:1, b:2}
let {a, c} = data; can be used as function object.
7. class : can-not overload member functions in javascripts (no overloading)
- this is explicit
- super("Circle")- creates a prototype chain
- static - should be out side class (ES-6), but in ES-Next
8. Arrow functions :- resolves the "this" and sets caller as context
9. Tamplate Literals : BackQuote ` and ${}
10. Module : Each file is a module, Multi Export and Import (import * as tm from "./sdas" - alising)
11. deafult export : one in a class : import default : without {} //default import is alias by deafult
12. Promise, Map/Set, 
    var myObject = [1, 2, 3]
    var newobj = myObject.map((val) => {
        console.log(val);
        return val*val;
    });   
13. ES7 : Array prototype
14. ES8 : async and await
    const getUsers = (ms) => { // No need to make this async
      return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
    };

    // this function is async as we need to use await inside it
    export const index = async (req, res) => {
        await getUsers(5000);

        res.json([
        {
            id: 1,
            name: 'John Doe',
        },
        { id: 2,
            name: 'Jane Doe',
        },
        ]);
    };

15. ES.Next : spread operdator for object (es6 for array only)
16. items.map((item, index) => `<CartItem id=${item.id} index=${item.index} />`)
    /// filter, map, some and reduce
    var persons = [
        {id : 1, name : "John", tags : "javascript"}, 
        {id : 2, name : "Alice", tags : "javascript"}, 
        {id : 3, name : "Roger", tags : "java"},
        {id : 4, name : "Adam", tags : "javascript"},
        {id : 5, name : "Alex", tags : "java"}
    ];

    //Filter
    var javscriptPersons = persons.filter(personObj => personObj.tags.indexOf("javascript") > -1);
    console.log(javscriptPersons);
    
    //Map
    var nameArray = persons.map(personObj => personObj.name);
    console.log(nameArray);

    //Some : Short Circuit as soon as it meets the condition
    var hasJava = persons.some(personObj => personObj.tags.indexOf("java") > -1);
    console.log(hasJava);

    //Reduce : Array.reduce is used when you want to process all the elements of an array to get a single value out of it.
    var uniqueTags = persons.reduce((acc, personObj) => {
                        acc[personObj.tags] = 1;
                        return acc;
                    },{});
    console.log(uniqueTags);

////VS Code 
>=

////React :
1. components : class and functional comps
2. Siblings can't share data directly
3. Props are immutable, don't modify
4. use ES.Next for event binding
5. all the methods are stacked but executed only once 
6. forceupdate will skip shouldComponentUpdate but setstate always reads shouldComponentUpdate.
7. key : is a Keyword and we can't read it in props , similar to children
8. Mutability : immutablity (mutable.js for huge data)
    cItems = [...items] //Spread operator clones data only, a shallow copy (copies data, with a new reference)
    object : cItem = {...item1, price:100} // item wont change
9. should not use splice method //use filter : this.state.items.filter(item => item.id != id );
10. LifeCycle :
        -Create,
        -DeStruct,
        -Update
11. Do not do much code in constructor, better use initialize method.
12. initialize state in componentWillMount.
13. use ajax calls in componentDidMount (client side rendering) will re-render
14. higher order components
15. User React.Fragment, use if no view to render.
16. use componentWillUnmount to clear call threads, unsubscribe etc - perfornmence
17. Update Cycle :- 5 steps
18. setstate also contains a call back, however it renders twice has specific case to use
19. Use Pure components for comparison
20. Component is not rendered everytime sigle instance be used everytime - render method
21. Do not pass arrow function,to avoid re-rendering in pureComponent
22. ToDo : Check if button component works alone not render

23. ref will be used only in and after componentDidMount.

/////React Router : browserHistory(HTML5)/HashRouter
1. react-router-dom is used to put routing on react supports both 
2. NavLink and Link can be used in switch
3. Switch : renders only the first child passed in router


//// Problems with react
1. Component state destroyed
2. Sharing Data at deeper level is not easy
3. Component setstate is async
4. Sharing data across component

//// : Flux is the architecture and Redux is implementation
1. Redux happened to be a predictable state/ pure function (output remains predicatable, no internal state)
2. PureFunction(items, item){return [...items, item]}


///// Redux ////
1. Actions : object containing type and payloads
2. Send action to store using store.dispatch. Acts as a contract
3. Action Creators : 
4. Reducers : Pure functions, follow single responsibility
5. Store : createStore and getState, dispatch - invoke action to strore (state, action)
6. Dispatch : Sync calls
7. Subscribe : called after every dispatch, recvievs a callback
8. unsubscribe : Every subscribe call has an unsubscribe
9. API's in call Store
 - createStore - (reducer callBack, initialValue for state)
 - getState
 - dispatch
 - subscribe
 - unsubscribe
 
 10. store can have one reducer at a time
 11. combineReducer :- combines reducers in key value pair {state: stateReducer}
 12. action should be unique across the reducers.
 13. VM already knows if switch contains the key, then only it calls the statement
 14. Multiple reducers are used to resolve associated actions across all the reducers
 15. Elem is the pattern used in reducer pattern.
 16. Store : Keeps data in javascript object by default but can be stored in local-storage
 17. redux-persist : library can be used to make data persistant
 18. Store : it can be multiple but as per architecture its not allowed, 
     its preferred to have a single source of truth - User and Auth Reducers
 19. segrgate code using at each module : Component,Container, State
 20. seed parameters can be passed along with combine reducers as Params.
 21. create containers for anything you want.



 //// code Splitting
 1. Loadable to split code
 2. 

 ///

 // bindActionCreators - react-redux
// returns a wrapper function
// that calls action creator method
// and dispatch
2. use : bindActionCreators(actionName, dispatch)
